Unit 1- HTML, CSS, Image Accessability

This week, my focus was to familiarize myself more with HTML, CSS, and linking images and CSS to HTML files. I also wanted to become more familiar with using commands in the terminal and pulling/commiting/pushing files in GitHub.

Ideas I was already familiar with before starting: I have a basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and linking images and CSS to HTML files from outside study and the prework. 

Ideas I was not familar with before starting: The only time I had practiced with the terminal before starting week 1 unit was for the SSH keys in the prework. GitHub was also very foreign to me.

Trouble areas: At first, I was very confused about how to initially upload files into GitHub. In the original code, I uploaded the files manually without using the push command on my terminal. Thankfully, I found a helpful guide in Unit 2 with instructions on how to create branches and push the updated files.

Things I want to continue to work on: Pulling/commiting/pushing files to GitHub
